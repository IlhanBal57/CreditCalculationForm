I have created a responsive loan calculation form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this form, after entering the amount you wish to borrow, you select the number of installments. Then, when you click the "Calculate" button, a window opens displaying the total repayment amount based on the selected number of installments and how much you need to pay monthly. If you want to close the newly opened screen, you can click the "x" button in the upper right corner, which will return you to the main screen.![Ekran görüntüsü 2024-07-08 011957](https://github.com/IlhanBal57/CreditCalculationForm/assets/167097961/a294b310-0b0b-4b3f-8bf7-b482925ccb05)
